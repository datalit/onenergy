# Ontario Energy Use Data Cleaning

This repository is created to show the data cleansing steps using Pandas. The data being cleaned is the [Ontario energy use and green house gases emitted by the Broader Public Sector data](http://www.ontario.ca/data/energy-use-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions-broader-public-sector).

Shows the amount of energy used and greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted for the Broader Public Sector, i.e., municipalities, municipal service boards, school boards, universities, colleges and hospitals.

Public agencies play an important role in helping Ontario meet its conservation targets and reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions. Beginning July 1, 2013 the Green Energy Act, 2009 requires Ontarioâ€™s Broader Public Sector (BPS) to report their annual energy use and Greenhouse Gas emissions, every year, to the Ministry of Energy.

The data contained in this file was provided by broader public sector organizations in accordance with this annual reporting requirement. A number of organizations also reported on facilities not required by the regulation.

This file contains 4 tabs:

tab 1 contains 2011 raw energy consumption and GHG emission data
tab 2 contains 2011 data that has been normalized to account for weather conditions
tab 3 contains 2012 raw energy consumption and GHG emission data
tab 4 contains 2012 data that has been normalized to account for weather conditions.
Normalized data allows BPS organizations and the public to accurately compare the energy consumption of similar BPS operations in one part of the province to those in another part of the province.

Missing or incorrect data is the sole responsibility of the BPS organization. The ministry has attempted to remove duplicate data from this data set to improve data integrity.

BPS organizations are required to make their information publicly available on their respective websites and in hard copy upon request.
